# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using various meteorological parameters such as Temperature, Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Dew Point, Humidity, Visibility, and Wind. By utilizing machine learning models, we aim to develop a system that can help forecast rainfall based on historical weather data.
